# dxread
This repository is the python version of dxread.c, for reading satellite
DX data. See the example in examples for a sample extraction of the
radiance.  pyqtgraph is used as a plotting library but may be easily
replaced by matplotlib. See the results folder for sample result images.

I had originally written these routines in yorick but have not included
the code.
